## How to run this locally

This should be very easy to get set up on your own thanks to Netlify CLI.

The only set up needed will be to create a .env file based on the .env.example file with your own Client ID and Client Secret. [Found Here](https://discord.com/developers/applications/) in the Oauth2 tab of an application
